# Clojure Coding Dojo: Tic Tac Toe

This project is created using [Nightcode](https://sekao.net/nightcode/) version 2.7.0.

Start by looking at [game.clj](./src/tic_tac_toe/game.clj).

Note: This assignment was heavily inspired by episodes 2-5 of the
["Functional Design in Clojure" podcast](https://clojuredesign.club).
